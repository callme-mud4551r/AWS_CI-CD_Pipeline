Great choice! Setting up a CI/CD pipeline with AWS Free Tier will give you hands-on experience with DevOps automation. Here's a step-by-step guide to get started:
## Project: CI/CD Pipeline with AWS Free Tier
# Tools Used:
- AWS CodePipeline (Orchestrates the CI/CD process)
- AWS CodeBuild (Builds and tests the application)
- AWS CodeDeploy (Deploys the application)
- GitHub (Source code repository)
- Docker (Containerization)
- Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)

## Step-by-Step Implementation
# 1. Set Up Your GitHub Repository
- Create a new repository on GitHub.
- Push a sample application (e.g., a simple Node.js or Python app).
- Ensure you have a Dockerfile and buildspec.yml for AWS CodeBuild.
# 2. Configure AWS CodePipeline
- Go to AWS CodePipeline and create a new pipeline.
- Select GitHub as the source provider.
- Choose the repository and branch to monitor for changes.
# 3. Set Up AWS CodeBuild
- Create a CodeBuild project.
- Define the build environment (e.g., Ubuntu with Docker).
- Use a buildspec.yml file to specify build commands:
version: 0.2
phases:
  install:
    runtime-versions:
      nodejs: 16
  build:
    commands:
      - echo "Building the application..."
      - npm install
      - npm run build
artifacts:
  files:
    - '**/*'


# 4. Deploy with AWS CodeDeploy
- Create an EC2 instance (Free Tier eligible).
- Install the CodeDeploy agent on the instance.
- Define a appspec.yml file for deployment:
version: 0.0
os: linux
files:
  - source: /
    destination: /var/www/html
hooks:
  ApplicationStart:
    - location: scripts/start.sh
      timeout: 300
      runas: root


# 5. Automate Infrastructure with Terraform
- Write a Terraform script to provision AWS resources:
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = "CI-CD-Server"
  }
}


# 6. Test and Monitor
- Push changes to GitHub and observe the pipeline execution.
- Monitor logs in AWS CloudWatch.
- Verify deployment on the EC2 instance.
